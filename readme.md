# File Service Server

## Overview

This project is a robust Spring Boot application designed to handle secure file upload and download operations. It provides a scalable, containerized solution for file management with comprehensive deployment options.

## Features

- **Secure File Upload**: Upload files using API key authentication
- **Easy File Download**: Retrieve files by filename
- **Docker Containerization**: Consistent deployment across environments
- **Kubernetes Support**: Scalable and reliable deployment
- **Flexible Configuration**: Environment-specific settings

## Prerequisites

- **Java Development Kit (JDK) 17**
- **Gradle**
- **Docker**
- **Kubernetes** (for cluster deployment)

## Project Structure

Key components of the project:

- **`FileController.java`**: Handles HTTP requests for file operations
- **`FileServiceApplication.java`**: Spring Boot application entry point
- **`application.properties`**: Configuration management
- **`Dockerfile`**: Docker containerization script
- **`build.gradle.kts`**: Gradle build configuration
- **Kubernetes Manifests**: Deployment, Service, and Ingress configurations

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/addyklicks/file-service-server.git
cd file-service-server
```

### 2. Local Development

#### Build the Application

```bash
./gradlew clean build
```

#### Run the Application Locally

```bash
./gradlew bootRun
```

The application starts on port 8080 by default.

### 3. Docker Deployment

#### Build Docker Image

```bash
docker build -t file-service:1.0 .
```

#### Run Docker Container

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 --name file-service-container file-service:1.0
```

### 4. Kubernetes Deployment

#### Apply Kubernetes Manifests

```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s/service.yaml
```

## API Endpoints

### File Upload

**POST** `/files`
- Requires `Celonis-Auth` header with API key
- Attach file in the request body

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Celonis-Auth: your_api_key" -F file=@/path/to/file http://localhost:8080/files
```

### File Download

**GET** `/files/{filename}`

```bash
curl -O http://localhost:8080/files/your_filename
```

## Configuration

Configure the application using `application.properties`:

- `celonis.api-key`: API key for authentication
- `file.storage.path`: Directory for file storage

## Expected Outputs

1. **Local Deployment**:
   - Application runs on `http://localhost:8080`.
   - Files can be uploaded and downloaded via API endpoints.

2. **Docker Deployment**:
   - Runs the application in a container accessible on `http://localhost:8080`.

3. **Kubernetes Deployment**:
   - The application is deployed as pods in the cluster, accessible via the Ingress endpoint.
   - Persistent volumes ensure file data is retained across restarts.




## Production Improvements and Scalability

To make the application fully production-ready, the following enhancements have been identified:

### Security Enhancements
- **Secrets Management**: Use Kubernetes Secrets to manage sensitive data like the API key securely.
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Implement OAuth2 or JWT for more robust security.
- **HTTPS Support**: Use TLS termination in Ingress to ensure secure communication.

### Scalability and Reliability
- **Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA)**: Configure Kubernetes HPA to auto-scale application pods based on resource usage.
- **Readiness and Liveness Probes**: Add health checks in `deployment.yaml` to monitor pod health and availability.
- **Zero-Downtime Deployments**: Use `RollingUpdate` strategy in Kubernetes to prevent disruptions during deployments.

### Monitoring and Logging
- **Centralized Logging**: Use solutions like ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana) for analyzing application logs.
- **Metrics and Alerts**: Integrate monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana for resource metrics and alerting.

### Data Persistence
- **Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs)**: Ensure file data is stored on durable volumes across pod restarts.
- **Backup Strategy**: Schedule regular backups to external storage like AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage.

### Code Improvements
- **Environment Configurations**: Use ConfigMaps or Spring Profiles for environment-specific settings.
- **Error Handling**: Improve exception handling for better client responses and debugging.

## Challenges and Multi-Realm Pipeline Design

### Challenges in Multi-Realm Deployments
Managing multiple instances (realms) of the application across cloud providers presents the following challenges:

1. **Environment-Specific Configurations**: Different realms require unique database hosts and service configurations.
2. **Consistency Across Realms**: Ensuring consistent application versions and configurations across environments.
3. **Scaling and Monitoring**: Scaling resources and monitoring performance across clouds.

### Solution for Multi-Realm Deployment

1. **Centralized CI/CD Pipeline**
   - Implement a unified CI/CD pipeline with modular stages for build, test, and deployment.
   - Use environment-specific branches or parameters for custom deployments.

2. **Configuration Management**
   - Store configuration files in a secure repository and dynamically inject them during deployment.
   - Use Kubernetes Secrets and ConfigMaps for managing environment-specific settings.

3. **Observability**
   - Use monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana with centralized dashboards for all realms.
   - Centralize logging with tools like Fluentd and ELK Stack for easier analysis and troubleshooting.
